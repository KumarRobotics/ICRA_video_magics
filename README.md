# ICRA Video Magics

A few scripts to help you go through your ICRA video submission process.

- `davinci_raw.sh`: A script to convert any video into the raw(ish) format required
by DaVinci Resolve on Linux (dnxhr_hq). These videos can be quite big, so be
mindful of the duration.

- `size_reducer.sh`: A script to compress your video to the required size for
submission while keeping the quality as high as possible.

## Requirements
 - `ffmpeg`
