# ICRA Video Magics

A few scripts to help you go through your ICRA video submission process.

- `davinci_raw.sh`: A script to convert any video into the raw format required
by DaVincy Resolve on Linux. These videos can be quite big, so be mindful of the
duration.

- `size_reducer.sh`: A script to compress your video to the required size for
submission while keeping the quality as high as possible.
